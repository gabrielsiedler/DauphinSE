<p>This website was developed with the objective of promoting the development of a possible e-commerce. It has a front-end properly advanced, with all modules fully commented and organized, ready for use. This site was developed using the technologies listed below:</p>

<div>
    <div class="half hLeft">
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In addition to using the various new Tags provided by the HTML5, this website was developed using the best programming practice, having a concise and organized structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>CSS3</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The CSS3 had their several new properties used. Some of these properties were desired but are not yet compatible with all browsers. The development of the css file was facilitated (a lot) because of the use of the <b>LESS Framework</b>, which allowed the use of variables and functions, which are essential for a fast and well done work. The attached css file on this site is in the format <i>.less</i> to show how it was developed.</li>
                   
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="half">
        <ul>
            <li>JQuery</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The JQuery was essential to make this dynamic layout, through animations, like the dolphin on the homepage, the page transitions in navigation, among others. Facilitations provided by this framework allowed us to make navigation ​​purely through <b>AJAX</b> in a esasier way.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Codeigniter</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The CodeIgniter is the php frameword adopted by the company. As this website was developed in order to show a possible front-end for an e-commerce service, it only really acted organizing the codes of the back-end and providing essential functions in an easier way.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
